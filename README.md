Dream Catcher  

They were intended to protect sleepers, particularly children, from terrible dreams, nightmares, and evil spirits. The air was filled with dreams, both pleasant and bad, according to Native Americans at night. The dream catcher would be hung above their mattresses. They had to make sure there was enough light to go through. It attracts and then traps all types of dreams and thoughts in its web, as the name implies. The traditional dreamcatcher's mechanism differs differently from legend to legend, but the purpose remains the same: to trap harmful thoughts or terrible dreams while you sleep, and to keep you safe with nice dreams and positive thoughts. The round shape of the dream catcher indicates the earth's spherical character, which is one of its most significant meanings. Bad dreams are absorbed by the web at night and then released during the day. The feathers, on the other hand, function as ladders that allow good dreams to descend upon the sleeping infant or adult.
